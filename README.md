# 100-days-of-code - Log
## Day0: January 11, 2021

   **Today's progress**: Made plans for code challenge, chose to create a calendar with events adding function. 
   
   **Thoughts**: I want to do my own full-stack project with ASP.Net Core and React, so I will use these technologies in this project.
             In the future, I still want to try NodeJs for back-end development.
   
## Day1: January 12, 2021 (The first day of coding challenge)
  
  **Today's progress**: Structured the application slient side, decided to copy the basic function of windows calendar.
  
  **Thoughts**: I made a mistake when pushing my code to github, as I forgot to pull first. Obviously I am still not familiar with git basic functions, I will take 2 hour in git                 learning.
