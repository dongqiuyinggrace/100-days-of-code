# 100-days-of-code - Log
## Day0: January 11, 2021

   **Today's progress**: Made plans for code challenge, chose to create a calendar with events adding function. 
   
   **Thoughts**: I want to do my own full-stack project with ASP.Net Core and React, so I will use these technologies in this project.
             In the future, I still want to try NodeJs for back-end development.
